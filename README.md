# assemble-js
Assemble different stacks for JS development for learning purposes.

## Purpose

This is an exploration of JavaScript libraries and their combination for building web applications.

## Goal

Find interesting combinations that help writing JavaScript web applications that are

* Modular
* Loosely coupled
* Unit testable
* Easy to work with during development
* Packagable for production deployment.

Different git branches are used for different combinations.

Currently, the libraries being explored include, on the client:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react)
* [Ractive](http://ractivejs.org)
* [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [lodash](http://lodash.com)
* [cujoJS](http://cujojs.com):
    * [wire.js](https://github.com/cujojs/wire)
    * [rest.js](https://github.com/cujojs/rest)
    * [when.js](https://github.com/cujojs/when)

For testing:

* [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)
* [tessed](https://github.com/scottcorgan/tessed)
* [tape-run](https://github.com/juliangruber/tape-run)
* [tape-catch](https://github.com/michaelrhodes/tape-catch)
* [tap-spec](https://github.com/scottcorgan/tap-spec)
* [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org)
* [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io)

On the server:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com)

For building:

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org)
* [stringify](http://johnpostlethwait.github.io/stringify)
* [reactify](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify)

This exploration of JavaScript libraries is as much about the journey as it is about the motivation of assembling a JavaScript web application stack composed of small, focused libraries instead of large frameworks.
